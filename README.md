## Devlog
Game objects are the planets of our universe that are shaped by various elements and materials that we call components in the Unity game engine. Without the components, the planet itself is just an empty shell, and the components is what really differentiates planet from each other. A scene is the planetary system that hosts all of the planets and creates a space for the different planets to co-exist.
